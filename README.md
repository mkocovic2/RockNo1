# RockNo1
RockNo1 is a band website made to share music and art. The website uses a user-friendly interface that seamlessly blends aesthetics with functionality.

## Features
- Cloud-Based Server: The website uses Firebase as the back-end, which allows the website to display images and music tracks. Firebase also contains a database to store user information, primarily emails.
- Dynamic Image Upload: Images can be dynamically uploaded through Firebase, allowing for the addition of images from anywhere. The page hosting these images updates dynamically as well.
- Dynamic Track Upload: The same thing with the images. MP3 and even MP4 files can be uploaded dynamically.
